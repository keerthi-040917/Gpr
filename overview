The hardware to generate the transmitting signal consisted of a signal generator AD9833 which was connected to ARDUINO UNO and programmed to generate a chirp signal. The idea is to transmit a signal to a certain level below the ground and capture the reflected wave,process and study the difference in frequency of transmitted and received wave.
The chirp signal was initially programmed to view in serial plot of Arduino IDE.
Later , we used filtering to enhance the generated signal and arrived at a conclusion in using a class AB amplifier.
